(ns kotoba.lang.pqh.vectors
  "Cross-language known-answer test vectors, generated programmatically from
   this repo's own npm deps (@noble/ciphers, @noble/hashes, @noble/curves,
   @noble/post-quantum, @ipld/dag-cbor) -- see vectors.edn (checked in
   alongside this namespace) and this repo's README \"Clojure/CLJC port\"
   section for the generator script this data came from. All random inputs
   were generated with node:crypto's randomBytes (never hand-typed hex) to
   avoid transcription errors.

   .cljc: `hb` (hex->bytes) is genuinely portable (delegates to
   util.cljc). `vectors` is :clj-only for now -- clojure.java.io/slurp +
   io/resource resource loading has no direct cljs equivalent without
   bundler-specific tooling this repo doesn't have (see README)."
